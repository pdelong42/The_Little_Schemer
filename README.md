The Little Schemer
==================

These are my solutions to the exercies in "The Little Schemer" (4th. ed.), by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

I use the same infuriating code conventions that I do in my LISP projects (sorry).  I promise that if I ever start writing LISP or Scheme in a communal environment, I will follow the prevailing coding conventions.
